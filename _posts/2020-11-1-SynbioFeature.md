We are delighted to publish this compilation of popular science articles centred on the topic of synthetic biology. This field offers innovative approaches to engineer or redesign biological systems facilitated by advances in genetic engineering, genome editing and the reduction in the cost of DNA sequencing and synthesis.  The social and ethical ramifications are an important aspect of the development and deployment of such novel technologies and this collection aims to highlight this.
