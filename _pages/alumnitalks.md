<b> Title: </b> Modeling the development and function of the blood-brain barrier in zebrafish.

<b> Date/Time: </b>  7PM, 21st November 2020

<b> Venue: </b> Google Meet

<b> Link: </b> [http://meet.google.com/ket-pqsu-aum](http://meet.google.com/ket-pqsu-aum)

<b>Biography of the Speaker:</b>
Jay Panji is currently a first-year PhD candidate at the Université Libre de Bruxelles in Brussels, Belgium. His research interests lie in understanding the mechanisms involved in blood-brain barrier formation and how they are perturbed in neurodegenerative disorders. He is currently working on developing a zebrafish model of the blood-brain barrier.  

<b>Abstract:</b>
Blood vessels are more than passive conduits for blood flow. Tissue-specific vascular beds not only match the metabolic demands of the perfused organs but also act as important signalling centres releasing angiocrine factors that govern tissue morphogenesis and function. Proper brain function relies on elaborate neurovascular communications that, when perturbed, often have disabling or fatal consequences. Hence, there is great interest in studying the mechanisms that shape the anatomy and control the functionality of the cerebrovasculature, not only to better understand how the brain develops and works, but also to elaborate innovative therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders. Neurovascular biology is a relatively young field and an integrated model of how, when and to what extent neural and vascular development are coordinated is currently lacking. Building this model will greatly benefit from the combined capacity to (i) scrutinize the cellular modalities of the highly dynamic processes of neurovascular development in real-time and to (ii) identify experimental settings where the signalling and circulatory functions of the blood vessels can, at least partially, be uncoupled.

<b> Title: </b> Helming Yama’s Buffalo: Molecular Regulation of RIPK3 Mediated Programmed Necrosis in Physiology and Disease

<b> Date/Time: </b>  7.30 PM, 6th November 2020

<b> Venue: </b> Google Meet

<b> Link: </b> https://meet.google.com/hmm-qujj-qrp 

<b>Biography of the Speaker:</b>
Kartik Gupta grew up in New Delhi and received a bachelor's degree in Biotechnology from Amity University and was a summer research fellow in many institutes such as ICGEB, NII, JNU and AIIMS. Driven by the scientific curiosity that this training had instilled, he joined the MS (research) program at IIT-M and worked in Dr. Aradhyam Gopala Krishna's lab from 2012-14 while spending one semester as part of DAAD scholarship at TU-Munich. He joined the Cell and Molecular Biology (CMB) graduate program at the University of Wisconsin-- Madison in 2014 in the lab of Dr. Bo Liu where he studied the basic science aspects of cell death with relevance to cardiovascular diseases. Outside of the lab, he is a coffee aficionado and also enjoys weightlifting and running.

<b>Abstract:</b>
Multiple programmed cell death (PCD) pathways have been discovered over the past 15 years that have challenged the synonymity of PCD with apoptosis. RIPK3 mediated programmed necrosis (or necroptosis) is unique within PCD pathways in its ability to proceed in the absence of caspases-- proteases that are widely involved in apoptosis and other PCDs. Instead, necroptosis occurs via sequential post-translational modifications involving the RIP kinases RIPK1 and RIPK3. Although the factors involved in necroptosis differ from apoptosis, the signalling complexes involved in key decision-making steps are shared, and how cells choose one form of PCD over the other remains a fascinating area of investigation. In this talk, I provide an overview of various PCDs and how this decision-making process plays out in deciding apoptosis over necroptosis in the same cell. I present data from my own research arguing that the cellular abundance of RIPK3 (which is a bottleneck in necroptosis) is regulated via multiple transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms and is key in this decision-making process. I will also present some recent findings from our lab and others on how the necroptotic machinery moonlights with the endosomal pathway leading to extracellular vesicle biogenesis.

<b> Title: </b> Dysregulation of Polycomb-mediated gene silencing in pediatric gliomas <br>

<b> Date/Time : </b> 7.30 PM IST, 31st October, 2020 <br>

<b> Biography of the Speaker: </b> 
Siddhant Jain recently obtained his PhD from the Department of Biomolecular Chemistry at University of Wisconsin-Madison. He completed his B.Tech. in Biotechnology from IIT Roorkee. He is interested in understanding the enzymes that alter chromatin structure and regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. In his doctoral work in Dr. Peter Lewis' lab, he discovered the biochemical function of a novel oncogene, EZHIP. He is off to a postdoctoral position with Dr. Cigall Kadoch at Harvard Medical School.   
  
<b> Abstract: </b> 
An aberrant transcriptional profile is a hallmark of several cancers. Chemical modifications of DNA and histones, modulate chromatin structure and regulate transcription. Consequently, enzymes that catalyze addition or removal of these chemical modifications are frequently mutated in cancers. Recent studies have identified recurrent histone H3K27M mutations or aberrant expression of EZHIP in Diffuse Midline Gliomas and a subtype of ependymomas. In my doctoral studies, we characterized the biochemical function of these oncoproteins as competitive inhibitors of a chromatin-modifying enzyme – Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). I will discuss the molecular function of PRC2 and the mechanism by which these oncogenes drive highly aggressive pediatric gliomas.
