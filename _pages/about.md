<p align="center"> I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in biological engineering and data science. I'm interested in addressing questions related to human diseases from a computational or data-driven lens and very excited by complex and dynamic systems. </p>

### Founders & Heads (2019,2020) 

#### Sahana Gangadharan

<img src = "../images/Sahana.jpg" width = "200" height = "200">

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in biological engineering. I'm interested in understanding the various aspects that govern development and communications within the brain, soul-stirring music and movies, and meeting new people.

#### Sankalpa Venkatraghavan 

<img src = "../images/Sankalpa.jpg" width = "200" height = "200">

I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in biological engineering. I’m interested in research centred on questions from biology - especially those studied using the integrated approach of experiments, modelling and theory, books that make you feel things and the art of science communication.<br>

#### Sathvik Anantakrishnan 

<img src = "../images/Sathvik.jpg" width = "200" height = "200">

 I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in biological sciences. I'm interested in interdisciplinary research, particularly in the use of physics and mathematical modeling to understand living systems. Outside of science, I love cats and all kinds of books. <br> [sathvikanantakrishnan.com](https://sathvikanantakrishnan.com/)|
