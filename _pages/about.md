| I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in biological engineering. I'm interested in understanding the various aspects that govern development and communications within the brain, soul-stirring music and movies, and meeting new people.| I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in biological engineering. Iâ€™m interested in research centred on questions from biology - especially those studied using the integrated approach of experiments, modelling and theory, books that make you feel things and the art of science communication. <br> [sankalpavenkatraghavan.com](sankalpavenkatraghavan.com)| I'm a fourth-year undergraduate majoring in biological sciences. I'm interested in interdisciplinary research, particularly in the use of physics and mathematical modeling to understand living systems. Outside of science, I love cats and all kinds of books. |
